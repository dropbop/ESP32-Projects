# ESP32 Projects

Monorepo containing my ESP32 projects. Mostly snippet-type code and proof-of-concept sketches to verify something works as intended. Each project has its own README with details. 

Secret details in each folder (e.g. wifi network details, ssh keys...) are kept as "secrets.h" files.
